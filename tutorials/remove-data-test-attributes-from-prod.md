### 1) install package to remove data-test attributes in prod
```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-remove-properties
```

if you are using `bit.dev` then install as the following: 

```bash
bit install babel-plugin-react-remove-properties
```

### Eject

Because we built our app with create-react-app, we need to run `npm run eject` so that we can gain full control to the configs in `package.json`

run `npm run eject` 
and you may have to commit your files first.
